# Advanced Testing

## Unit Testing and Integration Testing

### Unit Testing

Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation. The goal is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. In Python, the `unittest` module is commonly used for unit testing.

#### Example:

```python
# test_math_operations.py

import unittest
from math_operations import add, subtract

class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_add(self):
        result = add(3, 5)
        self.assertEqual(result, 8)

    def test_subtract(self):
        result = subtract(10, 4)
        self.assertEqual(result, 6)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Integration Testing

Integration testing involves testing the interactions between multiple units or components to ensure they work together correctly. It verifies that different parts of the system can communicate and operate as an integrated whole.

#### Example:

```python
# test_integration.py

import unittest
from math_operations import add, multiply

class TestIntegration(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_add_and_multiply(self):
        result_add = add(3, 5)
        result_multiply = multiply(result_add, 2)
        self.assertEqual(result_multiply, 16)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## Automated Testing with Selenium for Web Applications

Selenium is an automated testing framework that allows testing web applications by interacting with them in a real browser. It supports multiple programming languages, including Python.

### Example:

```python
# test_web_application.py

import unittest
from selenium import webdriver

class TestWebApplication(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        # Set up the Selenium WebDriver (assuming ChromeDriver is installed)
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()

    def test_login(self):
        # Open the web application
        self.driver.get('https://example.com')

        # Perform login actions
        username_input = self.driver.find_element_by_id('username')
        password_input = self.driver.find_element_by_id('password')
        login_button = self.driver.find_element_by_id('login-button')

        username_input.send_keys('your_username')
        password_input.send_keys('your_password')
        login_button.click()

        # Check if the login was successful (example assertion)
        self.assertIn('Dashboard', self.driver.title)

    def tearDown(self):
        # Close the browser after the test
        self.driver.quit()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This script uses Selenium to automate browser interactions for a web application. It opens the application, performs login actions, and checks if the user is redirected to the dashboard.

These testing examples cover unit testing, integration testing, and automated web application testing with Selenium in Python. Adopting such testing practices helps ensure the reliability and correctness of your software.
